# Buidl-Guidl-Reputation-Badge
Bespoke Soul Bound NFT that tracks credentials and reputation within Buidl Guidl
The purpose is to make a partly customisable Chibi-like SVG avatar, unique to each user through the use of pixle randomizer (Blockie) for the face. The Avatar starts off in a Nood/Noob state and as the particpant completes challenges in the Guidl so they unlock features (armour/weapons, etc) for their avatar. Armour sets are role/class-specific (knight/Pikeman/Archer. etc) A fully clad avatar represnets a Dev that has completed the basic Challenges. Additional armour details denote more experince. TBD
Flag pole elements behind the avatar will represent additional challenges/builds/hackathon experience - these can be customisable. TBD
A glowing arua of reputation will denote levels of respect bestowed upon the builder by peers thru a tokenised homage system. TBD
